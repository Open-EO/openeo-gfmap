title: "Preprocessing utilities"
---

The functions available in the `openeo_gfmap.preprocessing` submodule are mostly wrappers around OpenEO's processes. While GFMAP offers nothing new in terms of compositing, interpolation and band scaling, it collects a series of interesting tools not yet implemented natively in OpenEO:

* Cloud Masking: Best Available Pixel (BAP) Cloud Masking, Deep Learning Cloud Masking (to come soon?)
* SAR Preprocessing: Transform floating values of SAR backscatter into a compressed uint16 representation.
